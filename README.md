## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow Description

### üîç Problem Approach

I began by identifying a clean and scalable way to fetch, display, and cache public API data in a mobile-friendly UI.

### üìã Task Structuring

Tasks were broken down into the following steps:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Initialized the project with Expo
   - Configured React Native Paper for UI
   - Set up folder structure and navigation

2. **Theme Management**
   - Created a global theme toggle using Context API

3. **Data Layer**
   - Integrated CoinGecko API
   - Set up React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Enabled offline access using AsyncStorage

4. **UI & UX**
   - Built reusable components (coin cards, loading, error)
   - Designed Home and Detail screens
   - Implemented pull-to-refresh and search filter

5. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Used console logs and Expo's built-in debugger
   - Manually tested flows on iOS and Android with Expo Go

### ‚úÖ Feature Validation

Each feature was tested after implementation:

- Verified data fetching and caching under different network conditions
- Ensured smooth navigation between screens
- Checked dark/light mode toggle
- Checked search
